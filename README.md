# Chess

Chess is a two-player game. Player 1 controls the white pieces and Player 2 controls the black pieces. The UI is very simple, all the players have to do is type the coordinates of the piece they want to select (ColumnRow), then space, and then the coordinates of the square the player wants to move it to (ColumnRow). For example: "b2 b3" will move the piece at b2 to b3. If any sort of rule is broken, then the move will not occur and the player will be prompted to try again. The game will continue until Checkmate, stalemate, or when more than 1000 moves have occurred.
