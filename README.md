# Project: Matrix Game Simulator

This is a game simulator of existing games that make use of or are played on matrices. Currently this project will have two games: Chess and Checkers. Both are 2 player.

In order to play:

Compile Woo.java

Run Woo

And that's it, the game will begin.

You'll start in a main menu where you can select a game to play by typing in the corresponding number.

# Chess

Chess is a two-player game. Player 1 controls the white pieces and Player 2 controls the black pieces. The UI is very simple, all the players have to do is type the coordinates of the piece they want to select (ColumnRow), then space, and then the coordinates of the square the player wants to move it to (ColumnRow). For example: "b2 b3" will move the piece at b2 to b3. If any sort of rule is broken, then the move will not occur and the player will be prompted to try again. The game will continue until Checkmate, stalemate, or when more than 1000 moves have occurred.

# Checkers

Checkers is a two player game. Player 1 controls the red checkers and Player 2 controls the black checkers. The UI is nearly identical to the Chess UI. The player selects the coordinates of the piece it wants to move, and where it wants to move it to. Another example: 'c5 d6' which moves the checker in c5 to the position to d6. If any rule is broken, the move will not be completed and the player will be prompted to try again. The game will contiinue until a player runs out of checkers or if a player is in a position in which is is not possible to make another move.
